User: what is the connection between homogenus dynamical system and trace formula

Assistant: The connection between homogeneous dynamical systems and trace formula lies in the study of the dynamics of automorphisms on homogeneous spaces. Homogeneous dynamical systems are those where a Lie group acts transitively on a space, and the dynamical properties of this action are studied. Trace formulas, on the other hand, are mathematical tools used to study spectral properties of operators.

In the context of homogeneous dynamical systems, trace formulas are used to obtain information about the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the homogeneous space. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is a differential operator that generalizes the Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, and it plays an important role in the study of the geometry and topology of the space. The trace formula relates the eigenvalues of this operator to the periodic orbits of the dynamical system, which are the closed orbits of the action of the Lie group on the space.

The trace formula is derived using sophisticated mathematical techniques from analysis and representation theory, and it is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of homogeneous spaces.

5. 1.  Arithmetic Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds: Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold with finite volume and satisfying certain arithmetic conditions. By using the trace formula and the [[Langlands-Shahidi method]], one can compute the distribution of rational points on M with respect to the volume measure. This leads to a deep connection between the arithmetic properties of M and the spectral theory of certain Hecke operators acting on automorphic forms.
These trace formulas provide important tools for studying the spectral properties, period orbits, and geometric structure of homogeneous dynamical systems.

User: Mautner trace formula is very interesting, can you give me more information about it

Assistant:
The Mautner trace formula is a formula that relates the trace of a unitary representation of a Lie group to the integrals of the matrix coefficients of the representation over the orbits of the group. The formula expresses the trace of the representation π in terms of the invariant measures of the group and the geometric data associated with the action. It has applications in many areas of mathematics, including representation theory, number theory, and geometry.

The formula can be written more explicitly as:

Tr(π(g)) = ∫_H ∫_M π(guhu^(-1)) K(h,u) dμ(u) dμ(h),

where M is the homogeneous space G/H, and K is a certain matrix coefficient associated with the representation ρ. The formula expresses the trace of the representation π in terms of the invariant measures of the group and the geometric data associated with the action. It has applications in many areas of mathematics, including representation theory, number theory, and geometry. In particular, it can be used to study the spectral theory and periodic orbits of automorphic forms on homogeneous spaces.

The Mautner trace formula is sometimes called the stationary phase formula, because it can be derived using methods from stationary phase analysis in harmonic analysis. It was introduced by Robert Mautner in the 1950s, and has been generalized and extended by many mathematicians since then.
