At the beginning of my first year in Zurich, I studied about Selberg trace formula

And went through the basic knowledge about ergodic theory and dynamical system, in which the main theorem is about the equidistribution of horocycle flow

This is proved by Dani and smillie. And further generalized to the case of an arbitrary unipotent flow by Ratner. 

So a natural question is to get a more quantitative understanding about this equidistribution result: we want to have effective bounds on the rate of convergence in Ratnerâ€™s general result.

For $G=SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ with cocompact lattice, the effective bounds is obtained by Marc Burger:

Later by the work of Strombergsson, there are effective bounds for noncompact but finite volume situation. The main method of his work is decomposition of representation space with respect to eigenvalue of Laplacian.

And there are different approach as cochomology equation and classification of irreducible unitary representation by Flaminio Forni. Or considering the distribution of closed horocycle orbits by Peter Sarnak with Einstein series. But that's problem in a different category.

In order to study the property of horocycle flow, an important tool is representation theory, the important result including the decay of matrix coefficient

 and the classification of irreducible unitary representation.

For the next stage work, I want to consider a possible analogue of above result on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.
