Given an abstract representation of $GL(2)$, then realize it by concrete model, e.g. Kirillov model, then by the principal series of this representation, we can define the $L$ - function, then prove the fundamental functional equation by calculation of the $\gamma$ - factors, in calculation with Mellin transform, the idea is from [[Tateâ€™s thesis]] as well.This type of construction of $L$ - function is called Jacquet-Langlands $L$ - function.
