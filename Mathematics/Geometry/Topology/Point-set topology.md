### Def :: Discrete
A subspace of topological space $X$ is called discrete if every point in space $X$ is isolated and has its own singleton set as a neighborhood. This means that any subset of X can be considered as a union of singletons, making it the most fine-grained or "discrete" topology possible.


### Def :: Locally finite
A family $\{M_{a}|a\in A\}$ of subsets of topological space $X$ indexed by $A$ is called the locally finite if for any compact subset $K$ of $X$, $M_{a}\cap K\not=\emptyset$ for only finite many $a\in A$.
