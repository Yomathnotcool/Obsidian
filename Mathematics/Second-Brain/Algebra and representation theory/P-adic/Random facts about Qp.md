### $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is complete with respect to  the $\mid \cdot \mid_{p}$ but it's not algebraic closed.

### The algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is not complete due to [[Baire Category theorem]]
in which the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is of infinite degree of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.

Remark: The $p$-adic valuation can be extended to any finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, such that $v_{p}(p^{ 1/n})= \frac{1}{n}$,so $v_{p}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}(p^{1/n})^{\times})= \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(p^{1/n})$ can not be embedded into $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(p^{1/m})$. 
Remark of remark: $x^{n}-p$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, for any $n\geq 1$ by [[Eisenstein's criterion]], noted that $p$ is prime in UFD $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

An overkilling theorem, if $F$ is non-aglebraic closed field whose algebraic closure $\overline{F}$ is finite over $F$, then $F$ is elementarily equivalent to the real numbers.



### So for the complete algebraic closure $\hat{\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is denoted as $\mathbb{C}_{p}$.
