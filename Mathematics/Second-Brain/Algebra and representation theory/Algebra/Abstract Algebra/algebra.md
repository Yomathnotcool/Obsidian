A [[ring]] $A$ is a $k$-algebra in which $k$ is a field if $A$ is a $k$-[[vector space]] and if the multiplication is $k$-bilinear.

Its definition can be written down explicitly:
### Def :: $k$-algebra
A ring $A$ is a [[vector space]] over $k$ with an additional operation:
$\cdot: A\times A\rightarrow A$, it's $k-$bilinear, which means as following:
1. $(x+y)\cdot z=x\cdot z+y\cdot z$;
2. $z\cdot (x+y)=z\cdot x+z\cdot y$;
3. $(ax)\cdot(by)=(ab)\cdot xy$;

An algebra over a field $k$ is a ring which contains $k$ in its [[ring#^df6e2d|center]].
