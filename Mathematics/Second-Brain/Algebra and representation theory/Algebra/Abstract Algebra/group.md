### Def :: $G$-orbit
For a point $x\in X$, the set $Gx:=\{gx|g\in G\}$ is called the $G$-orbit of the point $x\in X$.

### Def :: Stabilizer of $x$
For a point $x\in X$, the stabilizer $G_{x}$ of $x$ is defined as $G_{x}=\{g|gx=x\}$.

### Def :: Properly discontinuous action






















### Rmk :: what is the difference between automorphism and endomorphism? $\text{Aut}(G)$ is the group of units of $\text{End}(G)$.

In group theory, both automorphism and endomorphism are mappings that preserve the structure of a group $G$. However, there is a significant difference between the two.

1. Automorphism: An automorphism of a group $G$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to itself. This means that it is a bijective mapping that preserves the group operation. In other words, if $f: G \to G$ is an automorphism, for any elements $a, b \in G$, the following properties hold: - The identity element is preserved: $f(e) = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. - The group operation is preserved: $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$.

Automorphisms are essentially transformations of the group that preserve its structure, including its elements, identity, and group operation. Examples of automorphisms include conjugation, where each element is mapped to its conjugate by an element in the group.

2. Endomorphism: An endomorphism of a group $G$ is a mapping from $G$ to itself that preserves the group operation. In other words, it is a homomorphism from $G$ to $G$. Unlike automorphisms, endomorphisms do not have to be bijective, meaning they may not necessarily be invertible. 

Endomorphisms can be thought of as mappings that transform the elements of the group, while still preserving the group's operation. Examples of endomorphisms include the map $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ that doubles every integer, or the map $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that squares every real number.

To summarize, automorphisms are bijective mappings that preserve the entire structure of a group, while endomorphisms are mappings that preserve the group operation but may not be bijective.
