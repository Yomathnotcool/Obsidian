There are too many versions of Hensel's lemma, so this note is to collect the versions of Hensel's lemma that I have met.

### $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$
Let $F(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots+a_{n}x^{n}$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$. Suppose that there exits a $p$-adic integer $\alpha_1\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ such that  $$
F(\alpha_{1})=0 \ \ \text{mod} p\mathbb{Z}_{p}
$$
and $$
F'(\alpha_{1})\not= 0 \ \ \text{mod} p\mathbb{Z}_{p}
$$
where $F'(x)$ is th formal derivative of $F(x)$. then there exists a $p-$adic integer $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ such that $F(\alpha)=0$ and $a\equiv \alpha_{1} \text{mod}p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.
