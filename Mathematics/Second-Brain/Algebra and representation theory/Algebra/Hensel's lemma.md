There are too many versions of Hensel's lemma, so this note is to collect the versions of Hensel's lemma that I have met.

### $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$
Let $F(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots+a_{n}x^{n}$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$. Suppose that there exits a $p$-adic integer $\alpha_1\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ such that  $$
F(\alpha_{1})=0
$$
