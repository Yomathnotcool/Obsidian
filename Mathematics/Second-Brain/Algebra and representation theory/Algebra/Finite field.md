Exercises for TA-finite field

Complete the proof of the following:
Let $K$ be a field and assume a ring homomorphism $\phi: R \to K$ exists. Then there exists a unique ring homomorphism $\tilde{\phi}:F(R)\to K$ such that $\tilde{\phi}\mid_{R}=\phi$.


Consider the field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, if $K$ is a number field of degree 2, i.e. an extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=2$, prove that $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d })$ for some square-free integer $d$. 

For a field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, if it's complete, will it  be also algebraic closed? Vice versa, if it's algebraic closed, will it be also complete?
