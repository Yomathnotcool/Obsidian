### The [[tensor product]] of Group representation

































### Remark:
Question: Is the tensor product of two irreducible representation of finite group $G$ irreducible?

![[Pasted image 20231229223422.png]]
The tensor product of two representation $(\pi_{1},U_{1},H_{1})$ and $(\pi_{2},U_{2},H_{2})$ is defined as 
$$
\Pi: G \to   GL(U_{1}\otimes U_{2})
$$
in which $\Pi(h_{1},h_{2})$ acts on $U_{1}\otimes U_{2}$ by $\Pi(h_{1},h_{2})u_{1}\otimes u_{2}=\pi_{1}(h_{1})u_{1}\otimes 1+1\otimes\pi_{2}(h_{2})u_{2}$.

And the representations $(\pi_{1},U_{1},G)$ and $(\pi_{2},U_{2},G)$ and $(\Pi,U_{1}\otimes U_{2},G)$ is claimed to be irreducible, in which $(\pi,U)$ can be considered as the representation of $G$ by pull-back $H_{i}$-action to $G$ via projection $p_{i}:G\to H_{i}$.
#### Proof:
