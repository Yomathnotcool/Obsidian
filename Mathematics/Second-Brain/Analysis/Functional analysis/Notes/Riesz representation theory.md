### Thm :: Riesz representation theory
If $T$ is a bounded linear functional on [[Functional Analysis#^85c1dd|Hilbert space]], then there exists some $g \in H$ such that  for every $f \in H$, 
$$
T(f)=<f,g>,
$$
Moreover $\mid\mid T\mid\mid_{op}=\mid\mid g\mid\mid_{H}$.

#### Rmk ::
In this context, we made use of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces, which states that for each continuous linear functional (i.e., mapping a vector from the Hilbert space to a scalar), there corresponds a unique vector in the Hilbert space itself.
