Automorphic forms are functions that are invariant under a certain group of transformations, and they are widely used in number theory, geometry, and analysis. The moderate growth condition is important when studying automorphic forms because it allows us to define and analyze various arithmetic functions and representations associated with the forms.

To understand why moderate growth is important, let's consider the example of modular forms, which are a type of automorphic form. A modular form is a function that is invariant under linear fractional transformations of the upper half-plane. In other words, it is a function f(z) that satisfies the following conditions:

-   f(z) is holomorphic in the upper half-plane.
-   f((az + b) / (cz + d)) = (cz + d)^k f(z) for all matrices (a, b, c, d) in SL2(Z), where k is a fixed integer.

The integer k is called the weight of the modular form, and it determines the rate of growth of the function as z tends to infinity. For example, a modular form of weight k = 0 has no growth (i.e., it is constant), while a modular form of weight k = 2 grows like z^2 as z tends to infinity.

To study modular forms, we often consider their Fourier expansions. Every modular form of weight k has a Fourier expansion of the form:

f(z) = ∑ a_n q^n

where q = e^(2πiz) and the coefficients a_n are certain complex numbers. The Fourier coefficients of a modular form are related to various arithmetic functions, such as the divisor function and the Ramanujan tau function, and they play a crucial role in understanding the distribution of primes, the behavior of L-functions, and the arithmetic properties of certain algebraic varieties.

Now, the issue is that for certain modular forms, the coefficients a_n can grow too quickly as n tends to infinity, making the Fourier expansion divergent. To avoid this problem, we impose the moderate growth condition on the modular forms. Specifically, we require that the Fourier coefficients satisfy the following estimate:

|a_n| ≤ C n^(k/2) e^(2πsqrt(n))

for some constant C, independent of n. This condition ensures that the Fourier expansion converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of the upper half-plane, and it is essential for establishing the analytic properties of modular forms.

In summary, the moderate growth condition is important when studying automorphic forms because it allows us to define and analyze various arithmetic functions and representations associated with the forms, and it ensures that certain integrals are convergent, which is essential for establishing their analytic properties.
