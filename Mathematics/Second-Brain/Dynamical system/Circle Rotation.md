## Def :: Circle rotation
First one should note the identify in mind:$S^{1}\cong \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\cong [0,1]$
Circle rotation is defined as $$R_{\alpha}: S^{1}\rightarrow S^{1},$$
in which $\alpha$ is the rotation angle.
## Thm :: If $\alpha$ is rational, $R_{\alpha}$ is periodic. If $\alpha$ is irrational, $R_{\alpha}$ is [[Lectures note about Dynamical System#^7946a0 | topological transitive]].



Before we prove this theorem, recall the pigeon hole principal:

Now we are ready to prove the theorem:
### Proof:
