### Thm :: Gauss map is [[Lectures note about Dynamical System#^3ec847|measure preserving]].

### Thm :: Gauss map is [[Lectures note about ergodic theory#^d8b2bc|ergodic]] for the Gauss measure $\mu(A)=\frac{1}{\log2}\int_{A}\frac{\text{d}x}{1+x}$.



This theorem is important with considering the application about the continued fraction expansion:

for a real number $x\in[0,1)$, it has a decimal expansion, the frequency of digit in the decimal expansion of $x$ can be found [[Doubling Map#^999c28|here in the section: other expansion maps]].

A rational number only gets finite fraction expansion.

A irrational number $x\in(0,1)\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ has continued fraction expansion $$x=[x_{1},x_{2},...],\ \ x_{i}\in\mathbb{N}.$$
What are the frequencies of digits with continued fraction expansion?

### Thm :: (Gauss-Kuzmin) frequencies of digits in continued fraction expansion
For $k\in\mathbb{N}$, let $D_{N}(x,k)=\#\{i=1,...,N|x_{i}=k\}$, 
$$\frac{D_{N}(x,k)}{N}\longrightarrow\frac{1}{\log2}\log(\frac{(k+2)k}{(k+1)^{2}}).$$
