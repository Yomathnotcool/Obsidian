### Def ::  orbit:
The evolution of the system is described by the sequence:
$$\{T^{n}(x)|n\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}\},$$
which is called the orbit of $x$.

### Def of fixed point:
$x$ is a fixed point if $Tx=x$.

### Def of minimal:
A (topological) dynamical system is called minimal if all orbits are dense.

### Def of topological transitive:
There is a dense orbit in the dynamical system.
