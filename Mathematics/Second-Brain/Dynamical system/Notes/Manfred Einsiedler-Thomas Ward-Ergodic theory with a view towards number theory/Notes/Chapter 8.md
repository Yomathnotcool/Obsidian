### Thm :: ergodicity for the right action of a locally compact group on itself.
Given a $\delta$-locally compact metrizable group $G$, $m_{G}$ left [[Haar measure]] on $G$, for any two [[measure theory#^03ea1a|Borel sets]] $B_{1},B_{2}\in\mathcal{B}_{G}$ with $m_{G}(B_{1})m_{G}(B_{2})>0$, the set $\{g\in G|m_{G}(gB_{1}\cap B_{2})>0\}$ is open and non-empty. And $\{g\in G\mid m_{G}(B_{1}g\cap B_{2})>0\}$ is open and non-empty. 

$m_{G}(B)>0$ if and only if $m_{G}(B^{-1})>0$ for any $B\in \mathcal{B}_{G}$.
