Given a topological group $G$ and a measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$,

### Def :: measurable action
$$
\begin{array}
\ G\times \Omega \to \Omega\\
(g,x) \to gx
\end{array}
$$
is measurable.

### Def :: Pullback of measure
$g_{*}\mu(A)=\mu(g^{-1}A)$


### Def :: invariant measure and quasi-invariant measure
$g_{*}\mu(A)=\mu$ for $\forall g\in G$.

quasi-invariant: if $g_{*}\mu$ and $\mu$ are equivalent: $\forall A\in \mathcal{B},\mu_{1}(A)=0$ if and only if $\mu_{2}(A)=0$.


### Def :: $\sigma$-finite
$\Omega$ is $\sigma$-finite if a countable union of measurable subsets of $\mu$-finite measure.



### Def :: Radon-Nikodym derivative of $g_{*}\mu$ with respect to $\mu$
