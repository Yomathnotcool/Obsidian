Given a set $X$ and a group $G$ without further structure: topology and measure, for an easy understanding, we can even consider the set $X$ and $G$ as finite.

Given group action of $G$ on the set $X$, 
$$
G\times X\to X: (g,x)\to g\cdot x
$$
then by this action, we can have an easy dynamical system.

Now we define the chain and cochain:
### Def :: $n$-Chain
Given a $n$-family $(g_{1},g_{2},\dots,g_{n},x)$ which can take as a oriented $n-$simplex

so for 1-chain, itâ€™s just
