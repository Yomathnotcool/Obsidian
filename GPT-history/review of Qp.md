what is the maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$?

as a field, maximal ideal is itself

the prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$ is $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

what is the generator of $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, which is also the uniformizer.

Is there any important results in ring theory if a ring has unique nonzero prime ideal

$L_{1}$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-submodule of rank 2, which is a lattice in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. Then what is $pL_{1}$.

Given another submodule $L_{2}$ defined as same as $L_{1}$, what does it mean by $$
pL_{1}\subsetneqq L_{2} \subsetneqq L_{1}
$$

I am confused because after scaled by $p$, the lattice is denser, then it should be $$
L_{1} \subsetneqq pL_{1}
$$

consider the equivalent class of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ lattice, $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are equivalent, if there exists $\lambda \in K^{*}$, such that  $L_{1}=\lambda L_{2}$, we denote the equivalent class as $[L_{1}]$ with the defined equivalent relation. then give me two examples of such equivalent class. 


now we can consider two equivalent classes $[L_{1}]$ and $[L_{2}]$, and they satisfy $$
pL_{1}\subsetneqq L_{2} \subsetneqq L_{1},
$$
can you give me an example?
