Consider the upper half plane $\mathcal{H}$ with cocompact lattice $\Gamma \subset G=SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ acting on it, then we have a compact hyperbolic surface $X=\Gamma \backslash \mathcal{H}$.
question 1: what is the definition of fundamental group of compact hyperbolic surface? is it only defined on compact surface?

Question 2: what is the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(X)$? is $\pi_{1}(X)=\Gamma$ true?
