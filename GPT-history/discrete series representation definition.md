Suppose there fore that $(v_{n})$ is a sequence in $D_{u_{0}}=\{v\in H_{\pi}\mid \phi^{\pi}_{u_{0},v}\in L^{2}(G)\}$ in which $H_{\pi}$ is the representation space of $\pi$ and $G$ is unimodular.
And it satisfies that $$
(v_{n},Tv_{n})\to  (v,f)\in H_{\pi}\times L^{2}(G)
$$
as $n \to \infty$. Choosing a subsequence if necessary we may upgrade the $L^{2}$ convergence and suppose without loss of generality that $Tv_{n}\to f$ almost everywhere.


for $f \in C_{c}(G)$, then $f \in L^{1}(G)$? and define the function $f(g^{-1})=\tilde{f}(g)$, we have that $\tilde{f}\in L^{1}(G)$?


$\int_{G}f*v(g)\overline{w}(g)\,dm(g)=<f*v,w>$, in which $f\in L^{1}(G)$,$v\in L^{2}(G)$, and fixed $w\in L^{2}(G)$, this shows that the integral defining $f*v$ exists almost everywhere, defines a function in $L^{2}(G)$.

why does the inner product show that the function $f*v$ is well-defined almost everywhere in $L^{2}(G)$. \


I have learnt the theorem that if a representation $(\pi,H_{\pi},G)$ of locally compact group $G$ is almost square integrable, then it's tempered. but is the inverse theorem true?


can you give a counterexample that a representation of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ that is tempered but not almost square integrable?

Why does unitary representation give that the representation is tempered? and the definition of almost square integrable is the diagonal matrix coefficient $\phi^{\pi}_{v}(g)=<\pi(g)v,v>\in L^{2+\epsilon}(G)$. I don't understand the definition that you used.

why does the principal series representation of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ is tempered?


Define sub-exponential growth as following: for locally compact group $G$, every compact subgroup $K$, $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }m(K^{n})^{1/n}=1$. Does $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ have sub-exponential growth?

Why is $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$  unimodular? And why does unimodular give us that $m(K^{n})=m(K)^{n}$.

Then how do you show that $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ has sub-exponential growth
