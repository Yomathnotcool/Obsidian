Fix $f_{0}\in L^{2}(X,\mu)$, $\epsilon>0$ and $g_{0}\in G$. there exists some $f\in C_{c}(X)$ with $\mid\mid f-f_{0}\mid\mid_{2}<\epsilon$. why do we know that such $f$ exists.


since $-I$ is in the centre of the $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, the subspaces $H^{even}_{\xi}$, $H^{odd}_{\xi}$ of $H_{\xi}$ are invariant


Consider the differential operators coming from universal enveloping algebra, $G$ is a Lie group and $\mathfrak{g}$ is the corresponding Lie algebra, $\pi$ is the unitary representation of $G$, then what is the meaning of symbol $\pi_{\partial}$. 


for tempered representations of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, why are those representations called tempered.
The term "tempered" in the context of representations of a group like $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ originates from harmonic analysis, a branch of mathematics that studies the transformation of signals and data as well as Fourier analysis and spectral theory.

Tempered representations are those representations that correspond to "tempered distributions". A tempered distribution is a kind of generalized function that has good transformation properties under the Fourier transform. 

In a specifically representation-theoretic context, a representation is tempered if the matrix coefficients are of moderate growth, which means they don't blow up too fast at infinity. In precise terms, a unitary representation $(\pi, V_\pi)$ of a Lie group $G$ is called tempered if for any vectors $v,w\in V_\pi$, the matrix coefficient function $g\mapsto \langle \pi(g)v,w\rangle$ is a tempered function on $G$. 

For $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, which is a non-compact group (but a locally compact group), the notion of tempered representations is particularly significant and manifests in the theory of automorphic forms.

The English word "tempered" can have different meanings depending on context. Without specific context, however, the most common translation into Chinese would be "调节" (tiáo jié), which denotes the sense of adjustment or regulation. 

In the context of tempered representations or tempered distributions as in the mathematical context discussed earlier, the term "tempered" could be translated as "有界性的" (yǒu jiè xìng de) which means "boundedness". But please note, specialized mathematical terminologies may vary, it's always good to refer to specific literature or peer-reviewed sources.

A transformation $T$ over a measure space $X$ preserves the measure class if $T_{*}\mu$ and $\mu$ define the same measure class, i.e. $T_{*}\mu(B)=\mu(T^{-1}(B))=0$ if and only if $\mu(B)=0$. So obviously if $T$ preserves the measure, i.e. $\mu(T^{-1}(B))=\mu(B)$, then $T$ preserves the measure class.
