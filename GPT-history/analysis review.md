Fix $f_{0}\in L^{2}(X,\mu)$, $\epsilon>0$ and $g_{0}\in G$. there exists some $f\in C_{c}(X)$ with $\mid\mid f-f_{0}\mid\mid_{2}<\epsilon$. why do we know that such $f$ exists.


since $-I$ is in the centre of the $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, the subspaces $H^{even}_{\xi}$, $H^{odd}_{\xi}$ of $H_{\xi}$ are invariant
