### For $G=SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\Gamma=SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, consider injective radius $r$, such that $$
\pi:G \to  \Gamma \backslash G
$$For projection $\pi$ from $B_{r}(e)=\{g \in G \mid d_{G}(e,g)\leq r\}$ to $$
B_{r}(\Gamma)=\{\Gamma g \in \Gamma \backslash G \mid d_{\Gamma \backslash G}(\Gamma,\Gamma g)=\inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma} d_{G}(e,\gamma g)< r \}
$$is injective.

The setting you've provided involves the special linear group $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and its discrete subgroup $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$. The injective radius $r$ is a critical concept when considering the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash G$, which is the space of left cosets $\Gamma g$ of $\Gamma$ in $G$. The distance function $d_{G}$ denotes a left-invariant metric on $G$, and $d_{\Gamma \backslash G}$ represents the induced metric on the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash G$.

Given this framework, you are concerned with the conditions under which the projection $\pi: G \rightarrow \Gamma \backslash G$, defined as $\pi(g) = \Gamma g$, is injective when restricted to the ball $B_r(e) = \{g \in G | d_G(e,g) \leq r\}$ around the identity element $e$ of $G$. The image of this ball under $\pi$ is denoted as $B_{r}(\Gamma) = \{\Gamma g \in \Gamma \backslash G | d_{\Gamma \backslash G}(\Gamma,\Gamma g) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma} d_{G}(e,\gamma g) < r \}$.

To ensure that $\pi$ is injective on $B_r(e)$, it is required that for any two distinct elements $g_1, g_2 \in B_r(e)$, their images under $\pi$ are also distinct in $B_{r}(\Gamma)$, i.e., if $g_1 \neq g_2$ then $\pi(g_1) = \Gamma g_1 \neq \Gamma g_2 = \pi(g_2)$. This will hold if and only if $g_1^{-1}g_2 \notin \Gamma \setminus \{e\}$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in B_r(e)$, because if $g_1^{-1}g_2 \in \Gamma \setminus \{e\}$, then $g_1$ and $g_2$ are in the same left coset of $\Gamma$ in $G$, making their images under $\pi$ equivalent, which would violate injectivity.

The injective radius $r$ plays a critical role here. It sets a bound within which distinct elements of $G$ are guaranteed to map to distinct cosets in $\Gamma \backslash G$, essentially determining a "safe" radius where the projection $\pi$ retains injective properties. Mathematically, the determination of the exact value of $r$, such that $\pi$ is injective over $B_r(e)$, involves analyzing the geometry and topology of $\Gamma \backslash G$ which can become highly non-trivial depending on the metric $d_G$ chosen and the properties of $\Gamma$.

For $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, determining a generic injective radius $r$ that satisfies these conditions involves deep understanding of the group's geometry, particularly hyperbolic geometry, as $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ acts by isometries on the hyperbolic plane, and $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ is a lattice in $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Such an analysis often requires a detailed understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic space, Margulis' lemma, and the discreteness of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ in $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$.

In essence, the exact value of $r$ for which the injectivity holds strictly depends on the specific properties of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, and the choice of $d_G$. In many practical situations, explicit computation of such an $r$ can be quite challenging and is often approached through indirect means, including the application of geometric and algebraic techniques pertinent to the structure of the groups involved.






### Consider the hyperbolic plane $\Gamma \backslash H$, in which $H$ is the upper half plane, then the closed horocycle is corresponding to the horizontal line in fundamental domain in $H$ under the action of $\Gamma$.
The framework of your question rests on the setting of hyperbolic geometry, particularly within the context of the action of a discrete group $\Gamma$ on the hyperbolic plane $H$. Here, $\Gamma \backslash H$ represents the quotient space formed by the action of $\Gamma$ on $H$. When $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, the space $\Gamma \backslash H$ is of significant interest in the study of modular forms and Riemann surfaces. The upper half-plane $H$ is a model for hyperbolic geometry, consisting of all points in the complex plane with positive imaginary part.

In hyperbolic geometry, horocycles are curves with the property that normal segments drawn to the curve are of the same hyperbolic length. In the upper half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry, horocycles can be represented in several ways, one of which is as circles tangent to the real axis (but not intersecting it) or as horizontal lines.

When considering the action of $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $H$, and specifically how horocycles are mapped under this action, it is important to observe that $\Gamma$ consists of matrices of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$ with integer entries and determinant 1. The action of an element $\gamma \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on a point $z \in H$ is given by Möbius transformation: $$\gamma z = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}.$$

Closed horocycles in the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash H$ correspond to the orbits of the action of $\Gamma$ on specific horocycles in $H$. A horizontal line in $H$, say $y = k$ for some constant $k > 0$, serves as a simple example of a horocycle in the upper half-plane model. This line is "closed" in the sense that under the action of $\Gamma$, it maps onto itself or onto another horocycle in a way that relates to a closed curve in the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash H$. The quotient identifies points of $H$ that are equivalent under the action of $\Gamma$, essentially "wrapping" or "folding" the plane into a more complex surface, typically of genus greater than one.

The fundamental domain of $H$ under the action of $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ can be chosen, for example, as a region bounded by two circular arcs that intersect the real line at $-1/2$ and $1/2$ and extend upwards to infinity. This domain gets "tiled" by applying $\Gamma$ to replicate the fundamental domain across the entire plane. The horizontal lines (horocycles) in this context serve as boundaries between these tiles, and when projected onto the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash H$, they correspond to closed curves that can be thought of as "horizontal lines" in the sense of their original geometric configuration, albeit in a topologically and geometrically transformed space where they may serve as boundaries or loops around the handles or "holes" of the resulting Rieman surface, reflecting the complex connectivity of the space induced by the action of $\Gamma$.

Understanding these concepts in-depth requires a solid grounding in hyperbolic geometry, the theory of modular forms, and the properties of quotient spaces formed by discrete group actions on manifolds, highlighting the intricate relationship between algebraic operations (the action of a discrete group) and geometric configurations (horocycles and their correspondence in the quotient space).




### So clearly the diameter of closed horocycle in $\Gamma \backslash H$ is getting smaller and smaller as $y \to \infty$, in which the $\infty$ is the cusp. 
Indeed, your observation reflects an essential property of the geometry of $\Gamma \backslash H$ concerning horocycles near the cusp at infinity. To understand this phenomenon, let's delve into the behavior of horocycles and their relationship with the cusp in the context of the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash H$, where $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, and $H$ is the hyperbolic upper half-plane.

In hyperbolic geometry, a **horocycle** is a curve equidistant from a point at infinity, the cusp in this context. In the upper half-plane model $H = \{z = x + iy \in \mathbb{C} : y > 0\}$, a horocycle centered at the cusp at infinity can be represented by a horizontal line $y = const$. As we approach the cusp at infinity (i.e., as $y \to \infty$), these horocycles get "closer" to the cusp.

When you take the quotient by the action of $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, the upper half-plane $H$ is effectively "wrapped" onto itself, creating a quotient space that is non-Euclidean and compactified by adding a point at the cusp at infinity, rendering it finite. The action of $\Gamma$ identifies certain points in $H$ with one another, leading to the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash H$ which can be visually represented as a complex, tessellated structure with a finite volume.

Horocycles near the cusp in $\Gamma \backslash H$ map to closed curves that shrink in diameter as they approach the cusp. This shrinking reflects the fact that, in the geometry of $\Gamma \backslash H$, distances are measured differently than in Euclidean space. The hyperbolic distance between points on a horocycle and the "point at infinity" (the cusp) remains constant along the horocycle, but when projected onto the modular surface, the visual representation makes the distance appear to contract as one moves closer to the cusp.

A key characteristic of hyperbolic geometry is that the length of horocycles decreases exponentially as they approach the cusp at infinity. This is contrary to the intuition from Euclidean geometry, where moving closer to a point does not by itself change the length or diameter of objects. In $\Gamma \backslash H$, as $y \to \infty$, the length of these closed horocycles (viewed as curves in the quotient space) indeed becomes smaller and smaller, which is a manifestation of the hyperbolic metric and the compactification of the space near the cusp.

This behavior has important implications in various areas of mathematics, including the theory of automorphic forms and spectral theory, where the asymptotic distribution of lengths of closed geodesics and horocycles plays a crucial role. It also connects to the ergodic theory, where the shrinking of horocycles near cusps can relate to equidistribution properties of certain sequences in $\Gamma \backslash H$. Understanding these shrinking horocycles around the cusp reveals deep insights into both the geometry of the modular surface and the dynamical systems that operate within.

### introduce the upper half-planemodel, with the standard Poincare metric $$
ds= \frac{\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }}{y}
$$by this metric, what is the distance between $\left(  -\frac{1}{2},i \right)$ to $\left(  \frac{1}{2},i \right)$.


### So approximately we have $$
e^{d} \sim \lvert z_{1}-z_{2} \rvert 
$$in which $d$ represents the hyperbolic metric and $\lvert \cdot \rvert$ is the usual distance on $\mathbb{C}$.


### Based on your clarification, let me improve my approximation $$
e^{d}=C(y)\lvert x_{1}-x_{2} \rvert
$$ in which $C(y)$ is a bounded function that depends on $y$ and $\lvert  \rvert$ is the real absolute value, and $d$ represents the hyperbolic distance between $(x_{1},y)$ and $(x_{2},y)$.


### Now consider a ball of fixed radius $r$ inside of the fundamental domain of $\Gamma \backslash H$ and moving this ball along $y$-axis, then gradually the ball will intersect with other copies of fundamental domain.
