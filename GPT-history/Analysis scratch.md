For the space of text functions: the space of the smooth functions with compact support: $$
C_{c}^{\infty}=\{u\in C^{\infty}(\Omega)\mid spt(u)\subset V \subset \Omega\}
$$
For $u\in C^{1}(\mathbb{R})$, we can define $\frac{du}{dx}$ by the integration-by-parts formula, namely,$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{du}{dx}(x)\phi(x)\,dx=\phi(x)u(x)\mid_{\mathbb{R}}-\int_{\mathbb{R}}u(x) \frac{d\phi}{dx}(x)\,dx  =-\int_{\mathbb{R}}u(x) \frac{d\phi}{dx}(x)\,dx
$$


Now we want to prove an inequality in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$,
Given $u \in C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega)$ with $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$, we want to prove that $$
\text{max}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}} \lvert u(x) \rvert \leq C \lvert \lvert D^{\alpha} u \rvert  \rvert_{L^2}, \forall \lvert \alpha \rvert \leq k
$$
By choosing a coordinate system centered about $x$, we can assume that $x=0$. why can we assume that?


For homogeneous spaces, $X=\Gamma \backslash G$, in which $G$ is any Lie group and $\Gamma$ is the lattice of $G$. Measure on $X$ is induced by a left-$G$-Haar measure and introduce $L^{2}$ and Sobolev norm on the space $C^{\infty}(X)$ of smooth functions on $X$.

Define a function $\omega$ on space $X$ a weight if it is a positve meaurble function and for every $g \in G$, there exists a constant $C(g)$ such that  $$
\omega(xg)\leq C(g)\omega(x)

$$
for all $x \in X$. We assume $C(g)$ is locally bounded.


Fixed a ball $B \subset G$ which is a compact symmetric neighborhood of $e \in G$, for every point $x \in X$, we consider the map $p_{x}: B \to X$ given by $$
g \to  xg.
$$
The map induces the morphism of HIlbert spaces $$
p^{*}_{x}:L^{2}(X) \to  L^{2}(B).

$$
Denote by $\omega(x)$ the norm of this morphism.

To formalize the concept you've described within the framework of homogeneous spaces and Hilbert space morphisms, let's put your statement into rigorous (\LaTeX) notation. We are considering a setup where (G) is a Lie group and (X = \Gamma \backslash G) is a homogeneous space derived from a lattice (\Gamma) in (G). We fix a ball (B \subset G) that serves as a compact symmetric neighborhood of the identity element (e) in (G). For each point (x \in X), we introduce a specific map (p_x: B \to X) and subsequently define a morphism of Hilbert spaces induced by this map. Here's how you can describe these constructions formally in (\LaTeX):
Given the fixed ball (B \subset G), for each point (x \in X), consider the map (p_x: B \to X) defined by [ g \mapsto xg. ]
This map induces a morphism of Hilbert spaces, which we denote by $$
p^{*}_{x}: L^{2}(X) \to L^{2}(B)
$$The action of this morphism on a function (f \in L^{2}(X)) can intuitively be thought of as pulling back the function (f) to a function on (B), through the operation carried out by (p_x).
We define the norm of this morphism, denoted (\omega(x)), as follows: 
$$
[ \omega(x) = | p^{*}_{x} |. ]
$$
In the Hilbert space context, the norm of a morphism ($p^{*}{x}$) is typically understood in terms of its operator norm, which, for a linear operator ($$
A: L^{2}(X) \to L^{2}(B)
$$), is given by $$
[ | A | = \sup{|f|{L^{2}(X)} \neq 0} \frac{| A f |{L^{2}(B)}}{|f|_{L^{2}(X)}}. ]
$$
Therefore, (\omega(x)) quantifies the maximal "stretching" effect that the pullback via ($p^{*}_{x}$) can produce on functions in (L^{2}(X)) when measured in the (L^{2}(B)) norm, providing a measure of how the local geometry of (X) around (x) impacts functions from the global perspective of (L^{2}(X)).

how to describe the map $$
p^{*}_{x}:L^{2}(X) \to L^{2}(B)
$$

$\omega(x)^{2}$ is the maximal cardinality of the fibers of the map $p_{x}$.

The statement regarding ($\omega(x)^2$) representing the maximal cardinality of the fibers of the map ($p_{x}$) requires a careful interpretation within the context of the mapping ($p_{x}: B \to X$) and its induced morphism $p^{*}_{x}: L^{2}(X) \to L^{2}(B)$. The fibers of a map refer to the preimages under the map of elements in its codomain. Let's unpack this in the specific setting of homogeneous spaces and the induced morphisms.
Understanding ($p_{x}$) and Its Fibers
The map ($p_{x}: B \to X$) is defined as sending ($g \in B$) to the point ($xg \in X$). Here, (B) is viewed as a subset of the Lie group (G), and ($X = \Gamma \backslash G$) is a homogeneous space constructed from (G) by quotienting out the lattice (\Gamma). Analyzing the fibers of ($p_{x}$) involves examining which elements in (B) map to the same point in (X) under ($p_{x}$).
Fibers' Cardinality and ($\omega(x)^{2}$)
Assuming the statement that ($\omega(x)^2$) reflects the maximal cardinality of the fibers of (p_{x}), it suggests a relationship between the distortion effect induced by the morphism ($p^{*}{x}) on (L^2$) norms and the redundancy or "thickness" of ($p_{x}$)'s mapping in terms of preimage sizes.
Critical Examination
In the rigorous mathematical context given, it's challenging to directly interpret ($\omega(x)^2$) as the maximal cardinality of the fibers without additional clarification or specification of the context, especially since ($\omega(x)$) was defined as the norm of the morphism ($p^{*}_{x}$, usually reflecting an operator's maximal "stretch" effect on functions' norms. The connection between this measure-theoretic operator norm and the purely set-theoretical notion of fiber cardinality is non-trivial and not directly apparent without further assumptions or explanations.
For instance, the norm ($\omega(x)$) (and by squaring, ($\omega(x)$)) could indeed relate to the measure-theoretic properties of the fibers, especially in settings where the size of fibers influences the pull-back function's ($L^2(B)$) norm. However, articulating this connection precisely requires a deeper analysis of how ($\omega(x)$) is exactly defined in terms of the map ($p_x$) and the structure of both (G) and (X).
Conclusion
Under standard interpretations, the relationship between ($\omega(x)^2$) and the maximal cardinality of fibers needs careful mathematical detailing beyond the definitions provided. It potentially involves deeper insights into the geometry of (B), the topology of (X), and the algebraic structure of (G) and ($\Gamma$), especially in how these entities interact under the map ($p_{x}$) and its induced morphism ($p^*_{x}$). Further elaboration or context might clarify this intriguing connection.
